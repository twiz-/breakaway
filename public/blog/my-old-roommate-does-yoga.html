<h5>My old roommate was on her way to her hot yoga class.</h5>

<p>I said, "I can't do hot yoga, It's too slow for me." She immediately started attacking soccer, "Oh, I'd much rather be running up and down a field chasing a silly ball!"</p>

<p>A couple things here.</p>

<p>You know the drill if you're a soccer fan living in America and having a discussion with somebody that doesn't quite get it. I went into the "World's most popular sport.." and "yes, goals are only worth 1 point is why it's considered 'low' scoring" routine.</p>

<p>But also, with that logic anything can be reduced to this sort of non essential fun sucking paraphrasing.</p>

<h6>hot yoga</h6>

<p>"...oh, I'd much rather sit in a flatulent filled room with a bunch of sweaty strangers.."</p>

<h6>riding rollercoasters</h6>

<p>"...oh, I'd much rather get whiplash while some little kid potentially vomits all over my lap.."</p>

<h6>curing cancer</h6>

<p>"...oh, I'd much rather stare in a tiny microscope all day being exposed to dangerous oncogenes.."</p>

<p>I don't particularly like playing football or baseball, but I can certainly appreciate the mental chessmatch between a pitcher and batter, top six, with 2 outs and a runner on 3rd. Or, the beauty in execution needed to drive the football 80 yds downfield with 4 min left in the fourth quarter. And yes, even the meditative introspection yoga demands.</p>

<p>She got me thinking how I would describe soccer if it wasn't just running up and down a field chasing a ball.</p>

<p>For me, (when it's played the right way) it really is poetry in motion. It's all the instruments in a symphony playing to the same tune. It's a blank canvas for each artist to express their individual creativity. Every game is a chance to author a new novel and no two stories are ever the same. It's an escape where literally, nothing else matters.</p>
