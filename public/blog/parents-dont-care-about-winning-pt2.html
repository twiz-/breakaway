<p>So why does all of this go out the window in the form of unacceptable sideline behavior, team jumping, and questioning of coaching methodology. Oh and of course there are the endless emails, phone calls, and conversations about their kid, and sometimes, even other kids on the team.</p>

<p>It’s not from a lack of understanding of the game.</p>

<p>Parents naturally want the best for their kids, and for many parents this means getting their kids into a good college. American youth soccer is a HUGE investment of TIME and MONEY for parents and players.</p>

<p>Parents fear if they don’t win, the team won’t get into the best tournaments, and if they don’t get into the best tournaments then they can’t be seen by college coaches and alas their ROI is not realized.</p>

<p>Parents don’t care about winning they care about putting their kid in the best position to be successful in life. In reality club soccer can greatly facilitate this in 2 ways-</p>

<ol>
<li>A player can get a scholarship to a university that the family couldn’t otherwise afford.</li>
<li>A player can get accepted to a university that would otherwise be difficult to get into without the added attention incoming collegiate athletes receive during the admission process.</li>
</ol>


<p>That’s a lot of pressure to put on a club soccer coach and why sometimes you feel the brunt end of a frustrated, overbearing parent.</p>

<h6>Simply put:</h6>

<p>If your team went 0-15 and went to 0 major tournaments, but every single player went on to play at their dream school and developed immensely as soccer players during the season, would parents care half as much about winning? Doubtful.</p>

<p>Parents don't actually care about winning.</p>
