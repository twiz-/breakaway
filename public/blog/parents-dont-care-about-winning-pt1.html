<h5>No matter how much parent's soccer education improves, they'll never be completely satisfied.</h5>

<p>Something we hear often in the states is that soccer (yes soccer) is not a well understood sport in this country. Especially, by a majority of youth soccer parents. We’re champions of the world’s most popular sport in a country that barely flinches when they see a 45 yard Messi-esque run and can’t fathom how a 0-0 match can still be entertaining.</p>

<p>This past World Cup in Brazil helped, but it was pretty clear that many Americans around the country were simply excited to cheer for something American and not necesarrily because of their love of the game.</p>

<p>"But if parents only understood soccer better, THEN they would understand my coaching decisions and always support them!" Sadly, this isn’t the case.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe me, consider parents of youth basketball players. A well understood sport this country is undoubtedly fanatical over. Do you think these parents are acting any different than soccer parents because they are well educated on the game?</p>

<p>They aren’t. They’re just...well...parents. Something changes when your kid is involved. Most all rational thinking goes out the window when you see your first born not playing in the “right” position or your youngest daughter getting specific instruction you don't agree with.</p>

<p>Parents want to see their kid’s team win and when they don’t the coach is always the first to blame.</p>

<h5>The good news</h5>

<p>Parent don’t actually care about winning.</p>

<p>If you surveyed your player’s parents at the beginning of the season and asked what the number one most important part of their child’s youth sports playing experience was, how many do you think would list ‘winning games’ as their answer? Probably not very many. You’re more likely to get answers like skill development, sportsmanship, commitment, work ethic, fun, integrity, etc.</p>
