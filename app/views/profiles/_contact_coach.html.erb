		      <h4>What's sending a message?</h4>
		      <p>Good question. This is a way to learn more about a player without actually contacting them.
			  The message you send above is sent to 54footy.com mail servers then routed to the club players coach with your
			  question and/or message. <p>You'll receive a copy of the email and the club coach will be given the
			  email you signed up with to contact you and answer your question. Simple.</p>
			  </p>
			  <p>
			  	<i>note: once you contact a club coach he may very well let this player or parents know.</i>
