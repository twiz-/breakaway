#####More specifically, it's only good, and not great.

Hopefully, you're striving for great. This mindset is good but only for awhile because at its core it's selfish. When you're a part of a team a selfish mindset keeps you at good and never elevates to greatness.

First to practice, last to leave undoubtedly improves you the individual but when you think about becoming a leader and achieving certain things only a **team** can achieve it's not enough. You need to elevate those around you and get the best out of your teammates and this mindset doesn't support that. 

Shifting your focus and efforts this way is a path to greatness because The Team will always have the potential to achieve more than the Individual.
