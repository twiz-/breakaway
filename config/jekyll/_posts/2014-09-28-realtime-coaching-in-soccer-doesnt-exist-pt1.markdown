Adidas miCoach Soccer Elite Real-Time Smart System came out some time ago and was used at last year's MLS all-star game. Basically, players wear chips that measure time, avg speed, max speed, distance, high-intensity distance, and number of sprints. This is then streamed to the coaches, on the sideline in real-time.

Obviously, the thought of any one of the coaching staff looking down at an electronic device the whole game and then making "real-time" decisions based on these numbers is pretty sickening. But, this raises a bigger issue for me.

Nobody ever really listens to their coach when they're on the field. You listen to the game. Sure, you have a general strategy communicated by the coach before the game, but part of the beauty in soccer is there aren't X's and O's for every imaginable scenario.

The game requires improvisation which requires creativity and that is something you can't hear from your coach on the sideline and certainly something you can't gather from a data sheet. At least not from the data sheet miCoach provides.
