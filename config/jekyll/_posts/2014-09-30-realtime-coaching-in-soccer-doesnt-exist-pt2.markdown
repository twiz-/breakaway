If players, don't listen to their coach then what is the role of a coach? I like the term manager or boss that other countries seem to use to define this position. They are there to empower a player that must be responsive to what the game calls for.

Does miCoach help to enable that? "Hey Quigsie, I see here that your total distance for the match was only 5.9 miles, as a Striker that's not good enough, I need you to work harder." Yelling this from the sideline would be utterly ridiculous. But, does communicating that after the match add value and empower the player?

Probably not.

Quigsie takes this feedback and runs his face off the next game. His total mile count for this game was 8.2 miles. His coach is still unhappy, "Coach, I did what you asked..."

The issue with data is and has always been making sense of the data we do have, rather than continuing to accumulate more and more data points. Quigsie famously quits after he loses the ball up top and every time that happens the opposing team is able to start their counter-attack much easier. 

My fear is miCoach data will help mask some of the intricacies of the game with its "analysis" and it will become a crutch of sorts for coaches.

"Hey Quigsie, I need you to work hard to win the ball back after you lose it up top. Everytime you don't work hard to win it back it leaves the rest of the team out to dry."

Listen to what Klinsman said about this sentiment.
