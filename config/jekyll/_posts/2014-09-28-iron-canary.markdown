######change environments as quickly as possible

Canaries were once used as a rudimentary warning system for coal miners that went deep into mines where the air could potentially be hazardous. If you didn't hear the canary singing you knew the air was toxic and soon you'd be in big trouble yourself. This crest is as a constant reminder to always be conscious of the footballing environment you put yourself in. As a player you won't last very long if you practice bad habits, give half efforts and aren't pushing yourself to be better every time you strap on your boots. 

Surround yourself with players that are better than you, demand more from your teammates, focus on the important fundamentals, express yourself, play with joy, always be asking your coach what you can improve, watch a lot of professional games, play futsal, eat healthier, get extra fitness in, so that your footballing canary will be always singing.
