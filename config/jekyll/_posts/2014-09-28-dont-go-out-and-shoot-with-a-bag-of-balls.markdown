#####How many times..

When you're looking to get extra work in do you take a bag of balls out and go shoot for an hour? You shouldn't.

Even as a striker, on a great day, you take probably 7-8 shots at goal. There are a number of other things you do far more often in a game that you can and should be working on.

How many first touches do you take? How many 1v1 situations do you get in? How many passes do you make? How many tackles? How often do you call for the ball? How many runs should you be making? How many turns?  

There are plenty of other things you do more often in a game that you should work on perfecting. Things that happen over and over again in a 90 min match. And when you get good enough at those other things a goal is nothing more than a pass into the back of the net anyway.
